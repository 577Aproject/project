# Project Chatter
Project Chatter is a system that can pull in data from Twitter and map it to Amazon Prime Video/IMDB titles. This data can be used to enrich Amazon’s current machine learning model for prioritization, personalization and customer’s experience on movies. Our system will be a website that showcases movie titles ranked by social media buzz. Through social media buzz, we can understand customer intent easily.
